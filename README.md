# [Project 1 :Web Application| Twitter Moods as stock price predictors](https://github.com/SiwenSusan/SiwenSusan.github.io/tree/main/Project%201)    

* Gathered around 1.6 million tweets related to COVID-19 and US-China Relations using Twitter API
* Clean and prepare the dataset including using the Textblob package to perform sentiment analysis. Train a positve_negative_determination model using the training dataset using the different models’ results as classifiers including linear regression, logistic regression, KNN, and SVM.
* Use Python to create a web application including the following features: app auto-update the data of today's dropdowns, graphs for visualizing the output, the top 3 sectors result for different models, and the tabs explaining the data and output 

# [Project 2: Application|The Markovian Candidate”: Speaker Attribution Using Markov Model]
(https://github.com/SiwenSusan/SiwenSusan.github.io/tree/main/Project%202)
* Implement a speaker attribution application using Markov Models.  It defined a probabilistic mechanism for randomly generating sequences over some alphabet of symbols. 
* Given a string of text from an unidentified speaker, the algorithm uses a Markov model for a known speaker to assess the likelihood that the text was uttered by that speaker.

# [Project 3:Web Application| Course Search Engine: Backend](https://github.com/SiwenSusan/SiwenSusan.github.io/tree/main/Project%203)
* Web scrapped data of course information from the website and saved it into a sqlite3 database
* Built the backend for a course search tool by gathering information from the database to process the user’s input


# [Project 4:Record Linkage](https://github.com/SiwenSusan/SiwenSusan.github.io/tree/main/Project%204)
* Train an algorithm to classify pairs of entries as matches, unmatch, and possible matches using probabilistic record linkage.


# [Project 5:Decision Trees](https://github.com/SiwenSusan/SiwenSusan.github.io/tree/main/Project%205)
* Built an algorithm that builds a decision tree from the training data and then returns a Pandas series of the classifications obtained by using the decision tree to classify each observation in the testing data.

* Take the data from The Pima Indian Data Set, which is from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository for example. The decision tree will classify if an individual has diabetes or not according to the training data’s others attributes information including,
Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), Triceps skinfold thickness (mm), and so on.


# [Project 6:Modeling Epidemics](https://github.com/SiwenSusan/SiwenSusan.github.io/tree/main/Project%206)
* Simulated the most commonly used epidemic model, the SIR model(Susceptible to the disease, Infected with the disease, or Recovered from the disease after infection (the model is named after these three states: S-I-R). 


# [Project 7:Modeling Language Shifts](https://github.com/SiwenSusan/SiwenSusan.github.io/tree/main/Project%207)
* Reproduced language shift model algorithm showed in Beltran, et al. ’s paper, A Language Shift Simulation Based on Cellular Automata. Started with a region of DL and SL speakers and simulate how language preferences change over time. 

# [Project 8:Polling places](https://github.com/SiwenSusan/SiwenSusan.github.io/tree/main/Project%208)
* Built an algorithm to calculate the ideal number of booths for voters to avoid voters get impatient and leaving without voting by calculating the median number of booths computed across the trials

* Code to simulate the flow of voters through polling places and analyze the interplay between different thresholds for voter impatience and the number of voting booths assigned to a precinct, and analyze the interplay between different thresholds for voter impatience and the number of voting booths assigned to a precinct.


# [Project 9:Visualizing Avian Biodiversity Using Treemaps](https://github.com/SiwenSusan/SiwenSusan.github.io/tree/main/Project%209)
* Generate treemaps to visualize this avian biodiversity data from samples taken throughout the year. Treemaps are a space-constrained method for visualizing hierarchical structures that present a sense of “mass” and proportionality in a way that the typical tree diagram does not. 
This algorithm can be used to visualize many different types of data, including stock portfolios, oil production, gene ontology, stimulus spending, and more.
